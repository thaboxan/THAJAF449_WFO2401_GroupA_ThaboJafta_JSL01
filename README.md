# [JSL01] Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

## Project Overview
As part of the [JSL] JavaScript Language (2024) course, I have taken on the challenge of building a JavaScript function to validate user input for a virtual pet adoption website. The primary objective is to create a function that checks if the user input follows a specific syntax pattern: starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers.

## Task
My task is to complete the `validateSyntax` function in the `script.js` file to perform the following:

1. Retrieve the user input from an input field with the ID `petInput`.
2. Define a regular expression pattern to validate the syntax of the input string (starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers).
3. Test the input string against the defined regular expression pattern.
4. If the input matches the pattern, set the result to "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, set it to "Invalid Syntax".
5. Display the validation result in an element with the ID `result`.

## Testing
To test my solution, I will follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter different pet adoption details in the input box.
3. Click the "Validate" button to see the validation result.
4. Open the browser's console and debug my code until there are no errors.

## Running the Code
To run the code locally, I will follow these steps:

1. Save the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files in a folder.
2. Open the folder in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Right-click on `index.html` and open it with a web browser (use Live Server if available).
4. Modify the `script.js` file to correct any syntax errors and save the file.
5. Refresh the browser to view the changes.
